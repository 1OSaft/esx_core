- Required for spawning as well as ESX Legacy

### Installation
- Modify your ESX config with `Config.Multichar = true`
- Set your database name for `Config.Database` in server/main.lua
- All owner and identifier columns should be set to `VARCHAR(60)` to ensure correct data entry
- Add the following command to easily update all of your SQL tables

```lua
	RegisterCommand('varchar', function(source)
		if source == 0 then
			for _, itable in pairs(IdentifierTables) do
				print('Setting `'..itable.table..'` column `'..itable.column..'` to VARCHAR(60)')
				MySQL.Sync.execute("ALTER TABLE "..itable.table.." MODIFY COLUMN "..itable.column.." VARCHAR(60)", {})
			end
		end
	end, true)
```
- Use the command from the console and then remove it
### Relogging
- Modify the config with `Config.Relog = true`
- Use the latest version of [ESX Status](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_status)
- Add the following event to any resources that will benefit from clearing ESX.PlayerData

```lua
RegisterNetEvent('esx:playerLoaded')
AddEventHandler('esx:playerLoaded', function(xPlayer)
	ESX.PlayerData = xPlayer
 	ESX.PlayerLoaded = true
end)

RegisterNetEvent('esx:onPlayerLogout')
AddEventHandler('esx:onPlayerLogout', function()
	ESX.PlayerLoaded = false
	ESX.PlayerData = {}
end)
```
- If you have any threads running with `while true do` you should change them to `while ESX.PlayerLoaded do`

#### The menu interface is esx_menu_default - you can use any version if you want a different appearance

### Conflicts
	- essentialsmode
	- basic-gamemode
	- fivem-maps
	- cui_character

### Notes
- This resource is not compatible with ExtendedMode or previous versions of ESX
- Legacy, skin, and identity must be updated to at least the minimum commits specified above
- Characters are stored in the users table as `char#:license` - if you need to use a different identifier then you need to modify ESX itself
- Character deletion does not require manual entries for the tables to remove
- As characters are stored with unique identifiers, there is no excessive queries being executed
	
### Kashacters
- This project is forked from the [kashacters multicharacter resource](https://github.com/FiveEYZ/esx_kashacter)
- Most of the code has been entirely rewritten
- KASH has given permission for this resource to use his code and the addition of a license
- The license obviously does not apply to previous versions and KASH has stated his resource is free to be used however

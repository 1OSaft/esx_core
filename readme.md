## ESX_Multicharacter
### Requirements
* [ESX Legacy](https://github.com/thelindat/es_extended) [Currently requires my fork]
* [esx_identity](https://github.com/thelindat/esx_identity) [Currently requires my fork]
* [esx_skin](https://github.com/thelindat/esx_skin) [Currently requires my fork]
* All `owner` and `identifier` columns in your SQL tables must be set to at least **VARCHAR(50)** to correctly insert data
* Do not run `essentialsmode` or `basic-gamemode`, and ensure you are using `spawnmanager`


### ESX Legacy  
* This resource is not compatible with previous versions of ESX or EXM
* Requires ESX_Identity and ESX_Skin to function properly - edits will be required to use other resources that modify character spawning
* You can not upgrade to this resource from the original release of kashacters; the methods used are entirely incompatible
* The player identifier used is set by ESX and by default only allows for a Rockstar License


### What's new?
Although kashacters provided an easy-to-use and free method of multiple characters, the method for doing so was inefficient and potentially database breaking.
* All users are created with a modified identifier entry, instead using `char#:identifier`
* There is no SQL table or modifications required for this to function
* Selecting a different character does not require modifying every instance of the characters identifier
* All tables containing an `owner` or `identifier` column are checked on startup, so character deletion will properly wipe all data
